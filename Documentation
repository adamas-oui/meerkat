I learnt a very important lesson: I did not document this project very well - 
in fact, not at all. I found myself completely forgot where I left before NYC trip.
Now I am creating this file to document my work from today.

****** what I did ******
successfully fixed the bugs for connecting and uploading data to MongoDB;
I also add personal token for github after they change the policy, which 
actually creates a problem for me [see what i am doing next session]
****** What I wanted to do but failed ******
render data from MongoDB to the frontend. I found that I have to create another 
page in order to use the method of creating another router, which is not what 
I want for the dashboard page. I am planning to do it after I finished the 
authentication. 
***** What I am doing next: ******
to fix the github problem, I tried solution from here 
https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/need-your-help-with-github-permission-denied-to-my-own-repo/17421/12
and it did not work - the error says:
fatal: 'git@github.com/adamas-oui/meerkat' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
